# clusterEX_cliques_Celegans

The information presented here is based on the publication "hsp-90 and unc-45 depletion induce characteristic transcriptional signatures in coexpression cliques of C. elegans" authored by Lukas Schmauder and Klaus Richter in Scientific Reports volume 11, Article number: 12852 (2021) 

Three types of tables can be found for download:

1. Full table of all experiments used to derive the network and the coexpression cliques
2. Full table of all genes and their association to specific cliques
3. Full table of all cliques and their GO-term, phenotype and tissue enrichment favorites
